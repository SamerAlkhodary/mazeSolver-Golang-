# mazeSolver-Golang-

# Algorithm 
  The program parses a maze int0 a graph 
  this Program uses Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest way through a maze 
 
# Usages
  1. go build
  2. ./ [binayName] inputFile.png outputFile.png

# Input data 
  the program can solve mazes that follow set of rules:
    - The maze walls color is black
    - The maze is surrounded by walls
    - The maze has an oppening at the top which serves as gate to the maze  and an oppening at bottom that serves as the exit
