# mazeSolver-Golang-

# Algorithm 

  The program parses a maze int0 a graph 
  this Program uses Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest way through a maze 
 
# Usages

  1. go build
  2. ./ [binayName] inputFile.png outputFile.png

# Input data 

  ##The program can solve mazes that follow set of rules:
    1. The maze walls color is black
    2. The maze is surrounded by walls
    3. The maze has an oppening at the top which serves as gate to the maze  and an oppening at bottom that serves as the exit
