# mazeSolver-Golang-

# Algorithm 
  The program parses a maze int0 a graph 
  this Program uses Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest way through a maze 
 
# Usages
  go build
  ./ [binayName] inputFile.png outputFile.png

# Input data 
  the program can solve mazes that follow set of rules:
    1- maze wall color is black
    2- maze is surrounded by walls
    3- it has an oppening from the top and the exist is oppening at bottom
